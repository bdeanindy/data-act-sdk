# D.A.T.A. Act — Public Explainer  
**Digital Autonomy Transparency & Accountability Act**

### What the D.A.T.A. Act Does
The D.A.T.A. Act secures your right to own, control, and protect your personal data. It creates clear, enforceable rules so companies and governments cannot access, use, or share your data without your explicit permission.

### Your Guaranteed Rights
- **Ownership** — You permanently own all your personal data.
- **Transparency** — You can always see what data is collected and why.
- **Consent** — No one can use or share your data without your approval.
- **Access** — You can download everything an entity knows about you.
- **Audit** — You can see who accessed your data and for what purpose.
- **Revoke** — You can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Data Lock** — You can block all access unless a valid warrant is issued.
- **Inheritance** — You control what happens to your data after death.

### Why This Matters
Your digital footprint has value — personal, financial, and constitutional.  
This Act ensures your data cannot be exploited without your consent.

### What Entities Must Do
- Provide a simple dashboard for transparency
- Honor revocation immediately
- Publish machine-readable data practices
- Maintain tamper-evident audit logs
